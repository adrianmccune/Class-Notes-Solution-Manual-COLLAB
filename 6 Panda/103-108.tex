The Sugar Sweet Company is going to transport its sugar to market. It will cost \$$3500$ to rent trucks, and it will cost an additional \$$250$ for each ton of sugar transported.
Let $C$ represent the total cost (in dollars), and let $S$ represent the amount of sugar (in tons) transported. Write an equation relating $C$ to $S$. Then use this equation to find the total cost to transport $16$ tons of sugar.

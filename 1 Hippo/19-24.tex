      $4585$

      \begin{itemize}
          \item Start with the ones place: $8 - 3 = 5$.
          \item Tens place: $2 - 4$ requires regrouping.
          \item Borrow from hundreds: $0$ becomes $9$, tens becomes $12$.
          \item $12 - 4 = 8$.
          \item Hundreds: $9 - 4 = 5$.
          \item Thousands: $5 - 1 = 4$.

    Ravi biked $745$ miles. John biked $411$ miles.
    How many fewer miles did John bike?

      \textbf{Answer:}
      $334$

      \textbf{Explanation:}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Subtract John's miles from Ravi's miles: $745 - 411$.
          \item Compute: $745 - 411 = 334$.
          \item So John biked 334 fewer miles.

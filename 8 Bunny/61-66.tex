Suppose a pendulum is $L$ meters long. The time, $t$, in seconds that it takes to swing back and forth once is given by $t=2.01\sqrt{L}$. If a pendulum is $7.84$ meters long, how long does it take to swing back and forth once?

Round your answer to the nearest tenth.

Suppose that an object is dropped from a height of $h$ meters and hits the ground with a velocity of $v$ meters per second. Then $v = \sqrt{19.6h}$. If an object hits the ground with a velocity of $27.1$ meters per second, from what height was it dropped?

Carry your intermediate computations to at least four decimal places, and round your answer to the nearest tenth.

The number of bacteria $P(t)$ in a certain population increases according to the following function, where time $t$ is measured in hours.
$$P(t) = 2700e^{0.25t}$$
Find the initial number of bacteria in the population and the number of bacteria after $8$ hours.

Round your answers to the nearest whole number as necessary.

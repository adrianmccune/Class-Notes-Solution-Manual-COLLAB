\noindent This module continues to develop more complex orders of operations, building on Refresh 1. You will work through prime factorization, more complex operations with fractions, and solving problems that represent real-world situations. Concepts in \textbf{Refresh 2} are supported by \textbf{Lessons 1A - 1D}, which review prime numbers and methods for factoring,  \textbf{Lessons 3A - 3D}, which revisit the rules for order of operations, and \textbf{Lessons 4A - 4G}, which walk you through an overview of fractions.

{\large Objectives:}

\vspace{.3 cm}
By the end of this module, students will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Identify the prime factors of a number. 
    \item Use Order of Operations to evaluate expressions using whole numbers, fractions, and decimals. 
    \item Compare and order numbers that include whole numbers, fractions, and decimals.
    \item Work with 2-dimensional figures to find missing lengths and perimeters. 
    \item Classify and label solid geometric figures. 
\end{itemize}

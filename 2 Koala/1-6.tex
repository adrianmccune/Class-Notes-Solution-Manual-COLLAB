    $9$ ft $5$ in
    
    \textbf{Explanation:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Add the feet: $5 + 3 = 8$ feet.
        \item Add the inches: $10 + 7 = 17$ inches.
        \item Since $17$ inches is greater than one foot, convert:
        \item $17$ inches = $12$ inches + $5$ inches = $1$ foot $5$ inches.
        \item Add this extra foot to the total feet: $8 + 1 = 9$ feet.
        \item Final height: $9$ ft $5$ in.

    Quotient: $35$
    
    Remainder: $3$
    
    \textbf{Explanation:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $16$ goes into $56$ three times because $16\times 3 = 48$.
        \item Subtract: $56 - 48 = 8$.
        \item Bring down the $3$ to get $83$.
        \item $16$ goes into $83$ five times because $16\times 5 = 80$.
        \item Subtract: $83 - 80 = 3$.
        \item Thus quotient is $35$ and remainder is $3$.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Divide each digit step-by-step:
        \item $5$ goes into $35$ exactly $7$ times → write $7$.
        \item Bring down $3$ → $3 \div 5 = 0$ → this creates the $0$ in the quotient.

    $7$ baskets

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Compute $300 \div 45$.
        \item $45$ goes into $300$ exactly $6$ times because $45 \times 6 = 270$.
        \item Apples remaining: $300 - 270 = 30$.
        \item Since $30$ apples are left, Dan needs one more basket.
